## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
